# Lab 01 report
In this lab, I learned how to create ad manage files using Git and Github.
I practiced adding, commiting, and pushing files to a remote reposistory.
I also learned hoe to create branches and merge them into the main branch.
Working with branches helped me understand how changes can be tested safely without affecting the main project.
Overall, this lab improved my understanding of version control and Git work flow.
